Capacitor Charging and Discharging Simulation Tool

A tool for simulating and visualizing the charging and discharging behavior of a capacitor in an RC circuit.

What is Capacitor and their application?
Capacitors are devices that store electric charge and energy, playing a vital role in various applications.They are commonly used as filters in DC power supplies and as energy storage banks for pulsed lasers.
One of their key characteristics is the ability to pass AC current while blocking DC current, which makes them essential in applications where the AC component of a signal needs to be measured.
Capacitors are also widely used in plasma physics, where their energy-storing capability is utilized for various experiments and applications.A capacitor can be slowly charged to the necessary voltage and then discharged
quickly to provide the energy needed. It is even possible to charge several capacitors to a certain voltage and then discharge them in such a way as to get more voltage.

This assignment features an RC circuit, which is one of the simplest circuits that uses a capacitor.
